**Instructions**

- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F \(176 C\). Set out a baking sheet and line with parchment paper. And to a large mixing bowl, add water and salt. Stir to combine and dissolve salt. 
- A little at a time, add the areparina and stir with a whisk or your hands \(our preferred method\). You may work your way all the way up to two cups, although we typically have 1\-2 Tbsp leftover. You’re looking for a dough that doesn’t easily stick to your hands, is moldable and moist, and can be rolled into a ball. Once you have that consistency, cover with a towel for 5 minutes. We did mix both white and yellow areparina as inspired by Teote \(optional\). 
- Uncover, grab a large handful of dough, and roll into a ball \(as the recipe is written, our batch made 6 large arepas, but it could also make 8\-10 smaller arepas\). 
- Carefully press the ball between the palms of your hands to form into a roughly 1/2\-inch thick disc. If it cracks a lot on the sides, your dough may need 1\-2 \(15\-30 ml\) more water. A little cracking is OK \- just use your hands to close the cracks by gently patting along the edges \(see photo\).
- Once the arepas are formed, heat a large cast\-iron or non\-stick pan over medium\-high heat. Once hot, add a little oil and swirl to coat. Then add arepas, giving them a little room in between so they don’t touch. Cook for 2\-3 minutes or until deep golden brown \(a few blackened spots are OK\). You're looking to form a crust. Then flip and cook for 2\-3 minutes more or until the underside is also browned.
- Transfer to your parchment\-lined baking sheet and bake for 15\-18 minutes or until slightly puffed up and a little more golden brown in color. Some people like to slice into them immediately, but I find they can be a little doughy in the middle at that stage, so I prefer to let them cool for 5\-10 minutes and serve while they're warm but not piping hot.
- To enjoy, slice in half and enjoy as is, spread both sides with vegan butter and a little maple syrup \(YUM\), or cut the arepa 3/4 of the way around, leaving a seam on the edge so you can “stuff” it like a pita. Fillings could include everything from [black beans](https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-1-pot-black-beans/) to rice to [guacamole](https://minimalistbaker.com/baked-plantain-chips-garlicky-guacamole/) or even our [Vegan Barbacoa](https://minimalistbaker.com/1-pot-vegan-barbacoa/)\!
- Best when fresh. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 3\-4 days or in the freezer up to 1 month \(cooked or uncooked\). Reheat in a 350\-degree F \(176 C\) oven until warmed through. If reheating frozen _uncooked_ arepas, I'd recommend letting them thaw first and cooking them as instructed.
