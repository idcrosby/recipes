# Fish Arepas

## Fish

1. Line a large baking sheet with parchment or silicone liner. In a small dish, stir together seasonings: 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper and evenly sprinkle the seasoning mix over both sides of tilapia.
2. Lightly drizzle fish with olive oil and top each piece with a dot of butter. Baked at 375˚F for 20\-25 min. If you want it to get a little browned around the edges, you can broil for 3\-5 minutes at the end if desired.

## Arepas

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F \(176 C\). Set out a baking sheet and line with parchment paper. And to a large mixing bowl, add water and salt. Stir to combine and dissolve salt. 
2. A little at a time, add the areparina and stir with a whisk or your hands \(our preferred method\). You may work your way all the way up to two cups, although we typically have 1\-2 Tbsp leftover. You’re looking for a dough that doesn’t easily stick to your hands, is moldable and moist, and can be rolled into a ball. Once you have that consistency, cover with a towel for 5 minutes. We did mix both white and yellow areparina as inspired by Teote \(optional\). 
3. Uncover, grab a large handful of dough, and roll into a ball \(as the recipe is written, our batch made 6 large arepas, but it could also make 8\-10 smaller arepas\). 
4. Carefully press the ball between the palms of your hands to form into a roughly 1/2\-inch thick disc. If it cracks a lot on the sides, your dough may need 1\-2 \(15\-30 ml\) more water. A little cracking is OK \- just use your hands to close the cracks by gently patting along the edges \(see photo\).
5. Once the arepas are formed, heat a large cast\-iron or non\-stick pan over medium\-high heat. Once hot, add a little oil and swirl to coat. Then add arepas, giving them a little room in between so they don’t touch. Cook for 2\-3 minutes or until deep golden brown \(a few blackened spots are OK\). You're looking to form a crust. Then flip and cook for 2\-3 minutes more or until the underside is also browned.
6. Transfer to your parchment\-lined baking sheet and bake for 15\-18 minutes or until slightly puffed up and a little more golden brown in color. Some people like to slice into them immediately, but I find they can be a little doughy in the middle at that stage, so I prefer to let them cool for 5\-10 minutes and serve while they're warm but not piping hot.

## Refried Beans

1. Heat canola oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat.
2. Cook garlic cloves in hot oil, turning once, until brown on both sides, 4 to 5 minutes.
3. Smash garlic cloves in skillet with a fork.
4. Stir pinto beans, cumin, chili powder, and salt into mashed garlic and cook until beans are thoroughly heated, about 5 minutes. Stir occasionally.
5. Smash bean mixture with a potato masher to desired texture. Squeeze lime juice over smashed beans and stir until combined.
