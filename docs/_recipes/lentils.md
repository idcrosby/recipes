### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 1 cup diced celery
- 1 cup diced carrot
- 3–4 garlic cloves, rough chopped
- 1 1/2 cups dry French Green Lentils
- 1/4 cup wine
- 4 cups veggie or chicken stock ( or water and 1 bouillon cubes)
- 1 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoon mustard
- 4–5 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1 teaspoon dried)
- 2 bay leaves
- (Optional) bacon

### Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add onion, celery and carrots and stir 4-5 minutes, then turn heat down to medium. Cook 4-5 more minutes and add the garlic and lentils. Cook 2 minutes stirring.

2. Add the wine. Let this cook-off, about 2 minutes.

3. Pour in the stock, salt, and mustard and stir until combined and bring to a good simmer. Add the bay leaves and thyme sprigs, cover and gently simmer on low heat  25-30 minutes or until lentils are tender.

4. When the lentils are tender, uncover and cook off any extra liquid ( or feel free to drain). Remove the thyme sprigs, taste and adjust salt.
