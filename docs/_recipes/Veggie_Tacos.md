### Ingredients

- 1 cup refried black beans
- 1 cup sweet potato puree, homemade or canned*
- 1 cup grated cheese
- 8 corn tortillas
- Olive oil

#### Avocado Salsa: (optional)

- 1 large avocado, diced
- 1 tomato, small diced
- 1/4 cup chopped red onion
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro
- Juice of 1 lime
- Salt, to taste

### Instructions

1. Pre-heat oven to 450 F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and brush with a small amount of olive oil. If corn tortillas arenâ€™t very pliable you may need to warm on the stove or microwave for about 5 seconds each before assembling tacos.

2. Spread about 1 tablespoon of refried beans on half of the tortilla and top with 1 tablespoon sweet potato and a sprinkling of cheese. Fold tortilla over and repeat with remaining ingredients. Brush the top of each taco with a small amount of olive oil and bake for about 10 minutes, flipping once.

3. Make the avocado salsa while tacos are baking. Add all ingredients to a medium sized bowl and mix until combined.

4. Let tacos cool for a few minutes before eating and top with avocado salsa, if desired. Recipe serves 2-3 people but can easily be adapted to make more.
