### Ingredients

- 16 ounces rotini pasta
- 1/2 cup of butter
- 1 medium yellow onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 Tablespoon creole seasoning*
- 1 1/3 cup heavy cream
- 2/3 cup of milk
- 1 pound Louisiana crawfish tails (or Lobster or Shrimp)
- 1 bunch green onions, chopped
- 2 Tablespoons olive oil
- 1 cup Parmesan cheese, grated and divided

### Instructions

1. Cook the pasta to al dente. Drain, reserving about 1/4 cup of the pasta water.

2. In a large saute pan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the onions and saute until soft and translucent.

3. Add the garlic and continue to saute another 2 minutes.

4. Add the creole seasoning and mix well. Saute another 2 minutes.

5. Add the cream and milk, stirring to combine. Simmer on low until the sauce begins to thicken.

6. Add the crawfish tails, gently stir to combine. Allow the crawfish to cook for about 3 minutes, just enough to heat through, then add the green onions. Stir.

7. Add the reserved pasta water and a drizzle of olive oil to the cooked pasta and stir to loosen up.

8. Add the pasta to the crawfish mixture, a little at a time. Stir completely to combine.

9. Add 1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese and mix well. Reserve the remaining parmesan cheese to add to individual dishes, just before serving.

10. Garnish with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese and more green onions.
