---# Salmon

## For the Salmon:

- 1 – 1 ½ lbs. salmon fillet cut into 4 pieces
- Olive oil

## For the House Seasoning:

- ¼ c. garlic powder
- ¼ c. kosher salt
- ¼ c. dried parsley
- ¼ c. dried minced onion
- ¼ c. dried basil

## Instructions

1. Prepare the House Seasoning: Mix ingredients together and store in an airtight container for up to 6 months.
2. Prepare the Salmon: Rub each piece of salmon with olive oil and sprinkle with house seasoning, to taste \(I use about 1 teaspoon of olive oil and ¼ teaspoon of seasoning per piece\).
3. Grill the Salmon: Heat coals, gas grill, or grill pan to medium heat. Place salmon on the grill. Cover and grill over medium heat for about 5 minutes per side \(maybe a few more minutes, depending on the thickness of your fish\). The salmon is done when it flakes easily with a fork
