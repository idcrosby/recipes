- 1¾ cups water
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1½ cups (10 oz) couscous

In a medium saucepan, bring the water (or broth), salt, butter, and oil to a boil. Stir in the couscous, cover tightly with a lid, and remove from heat. Let the couscous steam for 5 minutes. Use a fork to fluff the couscous and break up any clumps. Serve warm.
Freezer-Friendly Instructions: The couscous can be frozen for up to 3 months. When ready to serve, reheat it in the microwave until hot.
