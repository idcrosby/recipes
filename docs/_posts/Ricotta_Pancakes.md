---# Ricotta Pancakes

Ingredients

- 1 cup ricotta cheese
- 1 cup all\-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon fine salt
- 3/4 cup milk \(not nonfat\)
- 2 large eggs, separated
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Butter, for cooking

## Instructions

1. If your ricotta seems to have a lot of liquid, set it in a fine mesh strainer to drain off excess liquid about 30 minutes before you start cooking. If your ricotta seems fairly dry and compact, you can skip this step.
2. Whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Combine ricotta, milk, egg yolks, and vanilla in a separate, larger mixing bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the ricotta and milk mixture, stirring gently until just combined.
3. Beat the egg whites with a handheld electric mixer until stiff \(see Recipe Note\). \(Alternatively, whisk the egg whites by hand.\) Stir a small scoop of the egg whites into the pancake batter to lighten the batter, then 
4. Heat a griddle over medium\-high heat. Melt a small bit of butter in the pan, just enough to coat the surface. Use a 1/3\-cup measure to pour batter onto the hot griddle. Cook the pancakes for about 3 or 4 minutes, until the undersides are golden and you see a few bubbles popping through the pancakes. Flip the pancakes and cook another 2 to 3 minutes, until golden. Repeat with the remaining pancakes.
5. Serve the pancakes immediately, with maple syrup, fruit jam, lemon curd, or powdered sugar.
