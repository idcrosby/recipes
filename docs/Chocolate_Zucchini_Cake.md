## Directions

Instructions Checklist

- Heat oven to 350°F. Line a 9\-by\-13\-inch baking dish with parchment.
     Step 1
- Pour ¼ cup boiling water over the dates in a small bowl and let soak until very soft, 10 to 15 minutes.
     Step 2
- Meanwhile, toss the oats, sunflower seeds, and wheat germ on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake, tossing once, until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool.
     Step 3
- Stir together the toasted oats, sunflower seeds, and wheat germ with the raisins, butter, maple syrup, and salt in a medium bowl. Add the dates and knead with your hands until everything is sticky and coated.
     Step 4
- Press the mixture into a flat layer in the prepared baking dish. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour. Cut into 24 bars. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. _\*Check to be sure that the sunflower seeds were processed in a nut\-free facility._
